# 🛍️ Amazon Product Sales Analysis -- Power BI | Python | SQL | Excel

This project demonstrates a **complete data analysis pipeline** on an Amazon product sales dataset using **Excel**, **Python (Pandas)**, **MySQL**, and **Power BI**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze Amazon product listings and sales performance across categories. I focused on building an end-to-end data pipeline — starting from data extraction to delivering business-ready insights through a clean and interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **📊 Excel** – Used to extract and explore raw Amazon sales data  
- **🐍 Python (Pandas)** – Cleaned and transformed the data  
- **🗄️ MySQL** – Stored structured data with relational integrity  
- **📈 Power BI** – Created an interactive dashboard for final insights


##  Dashboard Insights

Here's what the dashboard reveals:

-  **Total Products** listed and analyzed  
-  **Average Rating** across all products  
-  **Total Sales** or revenue calculated from price and quantity  
-  **Rating Distribution** visualized using a donut chart  
-  **Discount Range vs Product Count** bar chart  
-  **Interactive Filters** for Category, Sub-Category, Brand

The dashboard is built to help decision-makers understand:
- Which products/categories are performing well
- How discounting correlates with product count
- How customers are rating products across categories

##  Project Workflow

1. **Excel Extraction** – Downloaded raw data and explored structure  
2. **Data Cleaning (Python)** –  
   - Removed nulls and duplicates  
   - Standardized column names  
   - Formatted data types and values using Pandas  
3. **MySQL Integration** –  
   - Created tables with proper constraints  
   - Inserted cleaned data for analysis using SQL  
4. **Power BI Visualization** –  
   - Connected MySQL to Power BI  
   - Built KPIs, donut/bar charts, slicers, and a clean layout

##  Key Takeaways

- Learned how to clean and standardize product-level data  
- Gained hands-on experience in **data pipeline creation**  
- Practiced data modeling and relationship setup in Power BI  
- Created visuals that tell a clear business story
